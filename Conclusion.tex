\chapter{Conclusion}

The internship majorly involved working in the field of automation which resulted in gaining substantial knowledge and experience in the said field. Technologies used during the course of the internship are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Shell Scripting
	\item Python Scripting
	\item Robot Framework
	\item UIAutomator
	\item Jenkins
\end{itemize}

All given work was always completed well in time and the work done can be considered as a long term (even though minor) contribution to the company. The Battery Performance Tests have found areas that need to be looked into to make the app more battery efficient. These tests will be used to gauge and compare battery statistics well into the future. The test cases added are now part of the Functional Verification Test suite and will be run whenever the FVT suite is run. During the course of implementing and running Battery Performance and Automated UI tests, few bugs were also discovered and reported to the concerned person, which were fixed in later versions. \\

Apart from professional skills, this internship lead to sharpening of corporate soft skills. Some of these are listed below:
\begin{itemize} 
	\item\textbf{Communication:} Learnt how communication works within the company, what interactions are to be kept formal (leave notice, work from home notice) and which interactions can be kept informal (consultation, ideation).
	\item\textbf{Adaptibility:} Learnt how to adapt to different situations and work with strict deadlines. 
	\item\textbf{Teamwork skills:} Any work done during the course of the project will directly or indirectly affect the work done by other members of the team. Hence discussions and planning to avoid conflicts with other's work was an essential part of the internship, which lead to gaining skills on how to work as a part of a team.
