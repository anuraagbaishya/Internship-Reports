\chapter{Conclusion}

During the course of the internship, I gained substantial knowledge and experience in the field of Automation. I worked with the following technologies:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Shell Scripting
	\item Python Scripting
	\item Robot Framework
	\item UIAutomator
	\item Jenkins
\end{itemize}

I was able to complete all given work, well in time and feel I have made some (even if very minor) contribution to the company. The Battery Performance Tests have found areas that need to be looked into to make the app more battery efficient. These tests will be used to gauge and compare battery statistics well into the future. The test cases I added are now part of the Functional Verification Test suite and will be run whenever the FVT suite is run. During the course of implementing and running Battery Performance and Automated UI tests, I also came across a few bugs which I reported to the concerned person, and these were fixed in later versions. \\

Apart from professional skills, I also learnt corporate soft skills. I learnt how communication works within the company, what interactions are to be kept formal (leave notice, work from home notice) and which interactions can be kept informal (consultation, ideation). I learnt how to adapt to different situations and work with strict deadlines. I gained teamwork skills as I worked in a large team where my work would directly or indirectly affect the others' work. Last but not the least, I got to interact and work with professional software developers, each having a different expertise and experience. This internship has been a great learning experience, both professionally and personally.
