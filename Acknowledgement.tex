I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my guides Mrs. Aparna Nayak and Mr. Rajeev Dixit, and my manager Mr. Ankur Mathur who gave me the golden opportunity to do this project at Citrix R\&D and guiding me through the course of the project.  I would like to thank Mr. Prashant Phatate (Software Development Engineer, Citrix R\&D) for his valuable and timely inputs which have helped me overcome certain obstacles in the project. This project has given me first hand experience in the field of automation testing and has helped me in learning and sharpening various new skills. I would also like to thank my parents and friends for their constant support and motivation.
