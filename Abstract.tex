This project involves performance of two types of tests, namely Battery Performance Testing and Automated UI Testing. The former stems from the fact that the amount of battery consumed by an app is a very important factor for user acquisition and retention. Users are more likely to use an app when it is battery efficient. Hence, in this project I have developed a Battery Performance Testing Suite for a given Citrix App, which gauges the battery usgae patterns and provides a detialed report on the same. The suite can also be used for comparison of battery consumption for different versions of the app.\\

The second part of the project involves adding a few new test cases and modifying few existing test cases in the Functional Validation Test (FVT) suite. A few functions were added and a few were modified in internal automation library used to perform Build Validation Test (BVT) and FVT. It also involves running BVT and FVT suites and ensuring changes don't break the test suites.\\
