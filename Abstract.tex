Battery Performance Testing refers to performance of tests to gauge the battery usage patterns of a given app and to find areas which are consuming more battery than anticipated. Such tests can help fix battery consumption issues and make the app much more battery efficient. Automated UI Testing is the practice of testing UI components of an app to ensure that all UI elements are functioning properly and any action or series of actions performed by the user does not lead to app crashes or app freezing.\\

Battery consumed by an app is a very important factor for user acquisition and retention. Users are more likely to use an app when it is battery efficient. Hence, in this project a Battery Performance Testing Suite for a given Citrix App has been developed, which gauges the battery usage patterns and provides a detailed report on the same. The suite can also be used for comparison of battery consumption for different versions of the app.\\

The second part of the project involves adding a few new test cases and modifying few existing test cases in the Functional Validation Test (FVT) suite. A few functions were added and a few were modified in internal automation library used to perform Build Validation Test (BVT) and FVT. It also involves running BVT and FVT suites and ensuring changes don't break the test suites.\\
